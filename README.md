- 👋 Hi, I’m @Solkarth
- 👀 I’m interested in anime and gaming!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to create models and overlays for my streams on twitch!
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on not much really, but if you are a vTuber streamer, would be willing to collab stream after I get to know you and your stream content.
- 📫 How to reach me... Honestly right now do a whisper to Solkarth on Twitch is best way now to reach me with questions. Currently doing work on new overlays and Model
because not paying for any commisions for proffesionals quite yet and realizing alot of work to do this. So focus is on that more then setting up contacts. I have a
twitter but I have difficulty with twitter. It's more for notification when I go live purposes.
